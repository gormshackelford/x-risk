Update from The Existential Risk Research Assessment (TERRA)

We found some new publications.

Our machine-learning model predicted these publications to be relevant to existential risk or global catastrophic risk. However, we need your help to assess whether or not they are truly relevant.

Please see <a href="http://www.x-risk.net{% url 'topics' slug=topic.slug state='new_medium_recall' %}">www.x-risk.net</a> to assess these publications (you will need to sign in before you can make assessments). Please refer to the Inclusion Criteria in the <a href="http://www.x-risk.net{% url 'methods' %}">Methods</a> when making your assessments.
