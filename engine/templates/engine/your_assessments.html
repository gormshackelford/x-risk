<h1>Your Assessments</h1>
<p>To start or restart an assessment, click the link to the bibliography that you want to assess (e.g., "Existential risk"), on the right side of the screen. Before you start, please read the <a href="{% url 'instructions' %}">Assessment Instructions</a>.</p>

<h1>Co-Authorship</h1>
<p>Anyone who assesses 500 or more publications will be eligible to be a co-author of a future publication about The Existential Risk Research Assessment (subject to quality control). The <a href="{% url 'scoreboard' %}">Scoreboard</a> shows the number of publications that you and others have assessed. For quality control, some of your assessments will be compared to assessments made by other people, so please think carefully about the <a href="{% url 'methods' %}"> Inclusion Criteria</a>.</p>
